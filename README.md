# senior-thesis-discord

This repository contains data and preprocessing scripts used for the {discord} chapter of my undergraduate thesis, *The Complete Package: An Applied Thesis for Programming in R*. 

The thesis can be found online at [senior-thesis.jdtrat.com](https://senior-thesis.jdtrat.com). 

The {discord} package, whose source code can be found [here](https://github.com/R-Computing-Lab/discord), was designed to help researchers easily perform genetically-informed quasi-experimental designs.
